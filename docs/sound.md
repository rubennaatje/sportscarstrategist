I don't know why I'm doing this, as it's not very important at all but maybe, just maybe it's more important than I think it is. 

Anyway, although the game will not have any realistic graphics in terms to real on track stuff (only a track map). It's something that people requested and I thought it would be pretty cool to simulate sitting on the pit wall with cars blazing past. Semi realistic, Doppler effect, realistic sounds and all. This is something I've worked on for a bit and i'm pretty happy to confirm this will make it into the game at some point. It adds a nice dimension and gets rid of the annoying ambient car sounds that other games have. 

The first goal will be just cars driving past on tracks, second goal is hearing pitstops and cars (slowly) driving past you. Rain should be an easy addition as well. 

I have experimented with some 3d sounds and I genuinely got some good results. I personally think that this could be a good addition to bring some extra immersiveness to the game as there will be no fancy graphics. 

Finding the right sounds (or legal sounds for that matter) is going to be one of the hardest part of this. And simulating the right engine sounds of course. But some form of sounds will make it.
