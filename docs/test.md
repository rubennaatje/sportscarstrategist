# What is this game?

This is a multiplayer sportscar race manager where you will guide a racing team through a race, you will mostly be put into the role as a race engineer. 
Analyzing telemetry giving feedback to the drivers but also a big part is deciding the strategy. Know the rules, go for it. 

Although this game will work with non endurance races it is focused on endurance racing, you can play it singeplayer in the same way as you do with multiplayer. You can just drop people an ip for them to join (be careful who you are sharing it with)

# Why not -insert alternative- ?

Even the most recent popular race manager that had an option for endurance didn't suit my needs. I wanted to feel like an actual race engineer, looking at cool graphs but also having a much more realistic feel to everything. Another thing is that lots of these games don't have the option to fill in a strategy beforehand, my game is a little more laid back where you can set the strategy in the beginning (and change it during the race of course) just to give you that extra bit of relaxedness, drivers aren't stupid and know when to bring in the car regardless or not you press on the button. 


# What exactly are we simulating?

Very basically said anything racing will work but the focus is on endurance sportscar racing. The default rules will be based on that too.

Goal for 1.0 is to have simple rules that sort are fit for a generic sportscar race from the 90s till modern times, minimum driver time. Stretch goal for that is to have different rules that you can set up per race like pitstop times, max stint length, tyre usage, etc. 

So you have to manage a lot of stints, driver swaps, tyres. One important aspect of endurance racing is damage, slight damage costing you a bit per lap, do you come in to get it fixed?

In the 24 hours of le mans it's almost impossible to make it to the end without one quick moment in the garage, you will need to decide at the right moment if a quick visit to the garage is better than risking it an perhaps having a long visit to the garage, or losing a lot of time on track of course.


# How far are you?
Early but surely

idk I just wrote that without a good reason, but yeah it is early I've been slowly working on it for months now. But it's all coming together soon. I expect an early playable alpha released by christmas but who knows. I'm genuinely happy with a lot of things build but it has been a lot of POC's and trying things out, fooling around instead of actual production ready work.

But the most important parts are set, my goals although stretchy are also set. I know what I'm going to build and have set goals that are reachable.
