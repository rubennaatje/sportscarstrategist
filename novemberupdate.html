I had trouble finding the time to work on this. Still I did, just a lot less than i wanted to.</p> <p>I have made progress though, especially the last few weeks!</p> <p>Most importantly has been some coding stuff, I have refactored a lot of the code. I have also been working on improving the performance, I had a 'memory leak' due to the cars collecting telemetry data whilst in the pits forever.. so the laps would never be finished and the object would keep growing every tick. I have also run some stress tests with around 80 clients, was a lot tougher for the backend but he could still easily handle it. I doubt 80 people will ever play this game.</p> <p>Other thing is that cars now actually drive on track, taking into corners into consideration etc.</p> <p>Also the frontend has new graphs, powered by e-charts this time. The third library I've worked with, however this one is exactly what I'm looking for so I will likely stay with it. Apexcharts had a lot of the things out of the box that I wanted but wasn't customizable enough and also didn't have as many features as I wanted. E charts does have those and has an insane amount of customizability. If I were to change I would likely move to d3.j.ls</p> <p>Another unplanned feature is that there's now customizable dashboards. You will be able to add new dashboards, add stuff to them, and drag n drop stuff. It's sort of half in there right now.</p> <p>I'm now further working on car logic / race logic, handling battles on track, etc.</p></div></section> <footer class="footer">
